<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Signal Operations are simply modifications to the time variable of the signal to generate new signals. These are pretty similar to the mathematical graphical tranformations from our good old Calculus text.

The three kinds of Signal Operations are Time Shifting, Time Scaling & Time Inversion(or Time Reversal)

Time Shifting is simply shifting the signal in time. When we add a constant to the time, we obtain the advanced signal, & when we decrease the time, we get the delayed signal.

Signals can be generated & can perform operations in matlab app via gui( no coding required)
